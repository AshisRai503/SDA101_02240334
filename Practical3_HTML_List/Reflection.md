a) Documentation
Main Concepts Applied

For this HTML project, I focused on creating a simple, organized course overview page using foundational HTML concepts:

    HTML Structure: I applied proper HTML structure using the <head> and <body> sections, which organized content effectively.
    Headings and Lists: I used different heading levels to create a hierarchy for easy readability and organized content into unordered (<ul>) and ordered lists (<ol>) for clarity.
    External CSS Linking: I linked an external CSS file (List.css) for styling, separating design from content for cleaner code.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired

Through this project, I learned:

    Basic HTML Layout: Setting up a simple, structured HTML page taught me the importance of organizing content into sections.
    Using Ordered and Unordered Lists: I learned when to use ordered versus unordered lists based on the type of information (e.g., ordered lists for schedules, unordered lists for tasks).
    External CSS Linking: I gained experience linking external CSS files to manage styling separately, which is helpful for keeping HTML files cleaner and more focused on structure.

b) Reflection
Key Takeaways

    Organized Content Layout: Structuring content into clear sections with headings and lists helped make the page easy to navigate and read.
    Separation of Content and Design: Using an external CSS file reinforced the importance of keeping HTML focused on content while styling is handled separately.

Challenges and Solutions

    Challenge: Organizing Information with Headings and Lists
        I found it challenging at first to determine which sections should use ordered lists versus unordered lists and how to organize information hierarchically.
        Solution: I reviewed HTML documentation and experimented with different heading levels and list types to improve readability and structure.

    Challenge: Linking External CSS File
        I initially struggled with linking the CSS file correctly, as the styles werenâ€™t applying.
        Solution: I double-checked the link path and file naming conventions, realizing a typo was causing the issue. After correcting it, the CSS styles applied successfully.
