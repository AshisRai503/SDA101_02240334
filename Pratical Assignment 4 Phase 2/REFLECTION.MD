Reflection on Portfolio Website Project
1. Concepts Applied and New Skills/Knowledge
Main Concepts Applied

The primary concept applied in this project was responsive web design using Flexbox and CSS Grid. These tools were essential for ensuring that the layout adapts smoothly across different screen sizes and maintains usability. A dark theme was also implemented, complemented with white and orange accents, which aligns with modern design trends focused on user accessibility and visual appeal.
New Skills and Knowledge Applied

    CSS Flexbox and Grid: Learning to effectively use Flexbox and CSS Grid layouts was crucial for creating a flexible, responsive design. By using these layout techniques, I could align elements within sections (e.g., the project cards, contact form) efficiently and ensure they adjust correctly on smaller screens.
    Web Accessibility and UI/UX Principles: Applying basic accessibility principles (e.g., contrast and hover effects) helped improve user experience for both desktop and mobile viewers. Incorporating these design principles was a valuable skill that enhanced both the appearance and functionality of the website.
    External Libraries: FontAwesome icons were used to add a professional look to social media links. This introduced me to the integration of third-party libraries, a skill valuable in many web projects.

2. What I Learned and Challenges Faced
What I Learned

This project strengthened my understanding of HTML structure, CSS styling, and responsive design principles. I also gained insight into effective color schemes and typography, especially with creating visually appealing yet functional dark themes. Additionally, I learned the importance of setting up a clear file structure and organizing CSS properties for easier maintenance and scalability.
Challenges Faced

    CSS Complexity: Managing CSS styling for different sections became challenging, especially when handling overrides and responsiveness. Balancing Flexbox and Grid layouts across screen sizes required troubleshooting and refining the CSS structure to avoid conflicts.

    Responsive Adjustments: Ensuring the contact form and project cards maintained their design integrity on smaller screens was a significant challenge. It required testing on multiple devices and making adjustments in the media queries to optimize for usability.

    File Organization: As the project grew, keeping the code organized and avoiding repetitive styles became difficult. I learned the importance of structuring CSS effectively and using comments for clarity.

Overall, this project was an enriching experience that taught me valuable technical skills, helped me tackle real-world design issues, and strengthened my problem-solving abilities within web development.
