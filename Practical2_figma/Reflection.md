Challenges and Solutions

    Challenge: Choosing the Right Color Scheme
        Finding colors that suited my personal brand while maintaining readability was challenging.
        Solution: I reviewed color theory resources and experimented with various combinations to achieve a look that felt both professional and approachable.
