a) Documentation
Main Concepts Applied

In this project, I focused on responsive design and micro-interactions using TailwindCSS:

    Responsive Design: I used Tailwind’s responsive modifiers (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:) to adjust font sizes and layout on different screen sizes. This ensured the page looked good on both mobile and desktop.

    Micro-interaction: For user engagement, I applied a hover effect on the "Discover More" button. Using Tailwind’s hover:bg-orange-600, hover:scale-105, and hover:shadow-lg, I created a smooth transition that adds a color shift and shadow when hovered.

New Skills and Knowledge Acquired

I learned to quickly build responsive layouts with Tailwind’s utility-first classes. I also gained new skills in applying hover animations and smooth transitions to enhance user interactions without writing complex CSS.
b) Reflection
What I Learned

This project taught me how utility-first CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS simplify responsive design and micro-interactions. I discovered that even small animations, like hover effects, make a site feel more interactive and user-friendly.
Challenges and Solutions

1. Cluttered Layout on Small Screens

    Issue: Initially, the text was too large on small screens, making the layout feel cramped.
    Solution: I used sm: and md: modifiers to adjust font sizes for smaller devices, which improved readability.

2. Button Overlap with Nearby Elements

    Issue: The hover:scale-105 effect caused the button to overlap nearby elements.
    Solution: I added padding around the button container, giving it space to expand without interfering with other elements.
