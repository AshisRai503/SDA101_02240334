a) Documentation
Main Concepts Applied

In this project, I created a Hostel Room Maintenance Form using HTML for structure and CSS for styling:

    HTML Form Structure: I organized the form using <form>, <fieldset>, and <legend> tags. Each section is grouped logically—Personal Info, Type of Issue, Description, and Urgency—making the form easy to navigate.
    Input Types and Attributes: I used a variety of input types (text, date, radio, textarea, datalist, and select) along with attributes like placeholder, autocomplete, required, and datalist to make the form more user-friendly.
    CSS for Background and Text Color: I applied a dark background color and white text color to create a high-contrast design, improving readability and aligning with a modern aesthetic.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired

Through this project, I learned:

    Using Datalists: I used the <datalist> element for the room selection, allowing users to choose from predefined options or type their room manually.
    Applying Different Input Types: Working with multiple input types and attributes helped me understand their unique functionalities and how they can improve user experience.
    Basic Styling with CSS: Setting a background color and font style with CSS gave the form a cohesive look, which was new for me in terms of design principles.

b) Reflection
Key Takeaways

    Organizing Forms with Fieldsets: Structuring the form into fieldsets with legends provided clarity and visual separation for each section, making it easier for users to fill out.
    User Experience with Input Variety: Adding datalists, text areas, and radio buttons made the form more interactive and efficient for users to complete.

Challenges and Solutions

    Challenge: Structuring Nested Fieldsets Correctly
        I found it challenging to create separate fieldsets for sections like "Type of Issue" and "Description" without disrupting the overall form layout.
        Solution: I researched fieldset usage and nested them carefully within the main form layout, ensuring each had a clear legend and purpose.

    Challenge: Working with Radio Button Groups
        At first, I struggled with grouping radio buttons correctly for the "Type of Issue" section, as multiple selections were initially possible.
        Solution: I ensured all radio buttons had the same name attribute, so only one option could be selected at a time.
