Main Concepts Applied

In this project, I focused on creating a visually appealing and functional design using the following core concepts:

    Layout Grids: I used grids to ensure alignment and spacing consistency across elements, creating a balanced and professional look.
    Components and Variants: I created reusable components for common elements (e.g., buttons, icons) and defined variants to support design flexibility.
    Auto Layout: This was applied to make the design responsive and adaptive, allowing elements to resize dynamically based on content and screen size.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired

During this project, I learned:

    Auto Layout for Responsive Design: Understanding Auto Layout in Figma was new to me. It enabled me to create components that adapt to different screen sizes.
    Using Color Styles and Typography: I gained insights on setting consistent color and text styles to ensure brand consistency and easy design updates.
    Prototyping Interactions: I explored Figma’s prototyping features to make clickable prototypes, which helped in visualizing and testing user interactions.

b) Reflection
Key Takeaways

    Design System Principles: Building consistent components taught me a lot about maintaining uniformity across a project, which is essential in design systems.
    User-Centered Design: I learned to think from a user’s perspective, prioritizing simplicity and clarity, especially when adding interactions.

Challenges and Solutions

    Challenge: Mastering Auto Layout
        Initially, I struggled with setting up Auto Layout correctly, as elements would overlap or misalign.
        Solution: I overcame this by exploring tutorials on Auto Layout, which helped me understand the constraints and padding options better.

    Challenge: Balancing Aesthetic and Usability
        Creating a design that looked good while remaining easy to navigate was challenging.
        Solution: I received feedback from peers and iterated on the design to improve usability without compromising the aesthetic.
