a) Documentation
Main Concepts Applied

In this project, I focused on creating a registration form for a college seminar using key HTML form elements:

    Form Structure: The form is structured with <form>, <fieldset>, and <legend> tags, which group personal information fields and add clarity.
    Input Types and Attributes: I applied various input types (text, date, radio, email, password, time, and select) with relevant attributes like placeholder, required, and autocomplete to ensure accurate data collection and enhance user experience.
    Accessibility Features: Using labels with for attributes linked to form fields improves accessibility by helping screen readers correctly associate labels with their corresponding inputs.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired

This project helped me gain:

    Experience with Different Input Types: I practiced using multiple input types, which allowed me to understand their specific purposes and the kind of data each can collect.
    Attribute Usage for User-Friendly Forms: Learning to use attributes like autocomplete, autofocus, and required has shown me how to make forms more user-friendly and efficient.
    Working with Fieldsets: The <fieldset> and <legend> tags were new to me and allowed me to create a more organized form by grouping related fields.

b) Reflection
Key Takeaways

    Creating a Well-Structured Form: Organizing form inputs logically makes the form easier for users to understand and complete.
    User Experience with Placeholder Text: Placeholder text provides users with an example of what to enter, which improves form usability, especially for fields like email and phone numbers.

Challenges and Solutions

    Challenge: Implementing Radio Buttons for Gender Selection
        Initially, I was unsure how to set up radio buttons correctly for the gender selection section.
        Solution: I researched HTML radio buttons and learned that grouping them by giving them the same name attribute allows only one option to be selected at a time.

    Challenge: Making the Form More Accessible
        I realized I hadnâ€™t initially connected labels to inputs correctly, which would affect accessibility.
        Solution: I used the for attribute in labels to explicitly connect each label to its input field, ensuring better compatibility with screen readers and overall accessibility.
