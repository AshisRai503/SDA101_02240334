a) Documentation
Main Concepts Applied

In this project, I created a structured list of upcoming college events using HTML and styled it with CSS for improved readability and user interaction:

    HTML Nested Lists: I used ordered lists (<ol>) for the main event categories and nested unordered lists (<ul>) for event details, such as the venue and time.
    CSS Styling for Readability and Interaction: I used CSS to style the event names with bold text and a hover effect to make them stand out. I also applied padding and margin to both ordered and unordered lists for cleaner spacing.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired

Through this project, I gained:

    Experience with Nested Lists: This was one of my first experiences creating nested lists, which helped me understand how to organize related information hierarchically.
    Applying CSS for Enhanced Usability: I learned to add basic styles like padding and margins for better readability, and I used a hover effect to make the events more interactive, which improved the user experience.

b) Reflection
Key Takeaways

    Organizing Content with Nested Lists: Structuring event details as nested lists made the layout clear and organized, with main events and their specific details grouped logically.
    Styling for Visual Hierarchy: Using bold text and hover effects highlighted the main events and helped guide the user's attention effectively.

Challenges and Solutions

    Challenge: Using Nested Lists Correctly
        Initially, I was unsure how to structure the main events and their details without mixing up ordered and unordered lists.
        Solution: I reviewed list documentation and experimented with nesting lists, eventually using an <ol> for main events and <ul> for event details to achieve the right structure.

    Challenge: Adding Hover Effects in CSS
        I was new to using hover effects, and I had trouble applying it to only the main event names.
        Solution: I created a CSS class named .Event for each main event list item and added a :hover effect to change the color to brown, which worked as intended.
