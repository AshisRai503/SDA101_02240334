a) Documentation
Main Concepts Applied

In this project, I designed a Simple Landing Page with HTML for structure and CSS for styling:

    HTML Structure: The HTML file includes essential sections such as a navigation bar, hero section, product grid, and footer. This layout follows a clean, modern structure that supports user engagement by highlighting important sections, like products.
    Responsive CSS Styling: The CSS file enhances the design by adding a consistent color scheme, layout, and responsive adjustments for different screen sizes. I used Flexbox for navigation and Grid for the product layout, which makes the page responsive and visually balanced.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired

Through this project, I gained experience in:

    CSS Flexbox and Grid: Flexbox helped align the navigation bar items, while Grid allowed me to create a flexible, responsive product grid.
    Responsive Design: I implemented media queries to adjust font sizes and layout based on screen width, enhancing the page’s readability and functionality across devices.

b) Reflection
Key Takeaways

    Creating a Clean Landing Page: Using a structured layout and concise design choices resulted in a clean landing page that is easy to navigate.
    Responsive Layout Techniques: Learning to combine Flexbox and Grid with media queries was valuable for creating a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Challenges and Solutions

    Challenge: Making the Hero Section Responsive
        Initially, the hero section text and image didn’t scale well across devices, resulting in poor readability on smaller screens.
        Solution: I used media queries to adjust font sizes for the hero section text, ensuring it looked appropriate on mobile, tablet, and desktop displays.

    Challenge: Ensuring Consistent Spacing and Alignment
        Aligning elements in the product grid and footer required consistent padding and margins.
        Solution: By using a combination of padding, margin, and gap in the Grid layout, I achieved uniform spacing across the page.
