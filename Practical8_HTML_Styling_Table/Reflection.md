a) Documentation
Main Concepts Applied

In this project, I created a Semester Grade Record table using HTML for structure and CSS for styling:

    HTML Table Structure: I used <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td> elements to display data in a tabular format, making it easy to organize and compare grades across different modules.
    CSS for Table Styling: I styled the table with CSS, adding borders, center alignment, and padding to enhance readability and give it a clean, professional look.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired

Through this project, I learned:

    Applying CSS Borders and Padding: I used borders to create a clear separation between cells, and padding to make the content within each cell more legible.
    Centering Content: Center-aligning both the <h2> header and the table content provided a balanced visual layout.

b) Reflection
Key Takeaways

    Organizing Data in Tables: Using an HTML table was effective for displaying multiple pieces of information (modules, assignments, grades) in a way thatâ€™s easy to read and compare.
    Styling for Consistency: Using consistent padding and alignment helped achieve a uniform look that improves readability and visual appeal.

Challenges and Solutions

    Challenge: Structuring Table Headers and Data Cells
        Initially, I found it tricky to arrange the table with both header and data rows in a way that looked organized.
        Solution: I reviewed how to structure tables with <th> for headers and <td> for data, ensuring that each row and column was labeled accurately.

    Challenge: Applying CSS Styling to Table Elements
        Setting consistent border and padding styles to the table, rows, and cells was challenging as I had to manage spacing while keeping the table compact.
        Solution: I defined styles for <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td> collectively and individually where needed, using border-collapse to merge borders smoothly and padding for cell spacing.
